# Daily-Planner

## Still under construction

I made this daily planner as a project and something I wish to use to help order all the things going on in my daily life.

# How it's made:
**Programming languages:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, nodeJS
As this is my first self made full stack project, I include everthing from front-end to back-end. I use JavaScript for the logic and interactivity of the different modules, I also use nodeJS to provide a localhost server to run client-side.

# Observations
This was a challenge to setup for me as I built this completly from scratch without the guide of a bootcamp or tutorial.
