# Daily-Planner
I made this daily planner as a project and something I wish to use to help order all the things going on in my daily life.
## App features
-Clean and intuitive UI for seamless interaction<br>
-Switch bewteen year, month and week calendars<br>
-Set titles and times of tasks and display on calendars<br>
-Save task data using javaScript localStorage<br>
-Clean and maintainable code<br>
## How it's made:
**Programming languages:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, nodeJS
As this is my first self made full stack project, I include everthing from front-end to back-end. I use JavaScript for the logic and interactivity of the different modules, I also use nodeJS to provide a localhost server to run client-side.
## Installation
1. Clone git repo to your local machine - copy repo url and paste `git clone [repo-url]` into bash terminal
2. Install npm package - Open 'Daily-Planner' directory in bash terminal and enter `npm install`
3. Run shell script - Once package intallation is complete enter into terminal `npm run start`
4. Open local host in browser - Open your preffered browser and enter into the address bar `localhost:3000`
## Observations
This was a challenge to setup for me as I built this completly from scratch without the guide of a bootcamp or tutorial, it strictly only uses vanilla javaScript for logic and it was a new experience to setup elements using the Date object in javaScript.
